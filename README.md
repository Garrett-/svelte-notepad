# Svelte Notepad Example App

A simple note taking application built with [svelte](https://svelte.technology/).
This application is based off of the [svelte-example](https://github.com/charpeni/svelte-example) application by Nicolas Charpentier.

Be forwarned that this application is more functional than decrotave, meaning it doesn't look that great. In the application are examples of triggering custom events, setting up and tearing down observers, passing data between components, using refs to access DOM elements, and using local storage to save and retrive data in and out of components.

## Future

Some additions I plan to add.

1. Markdown support
2. Better styling
3. Deleting notes
4. Testing

## Building

Take a look at the svelte-example application to see how to install and play with this application. If you want to **get started quick**, clone the app then run `npm install` or `yarn` then build it `npm run build`. Load up `/public/index.html` in your favorite browser.

Also `npm run build:watch` is available if you want to make quick changes.
